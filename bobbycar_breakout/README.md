# hoverboard-breakout

Breakout board for hoverboard mainboards, it grands easy access to the boards uart, analog inputs PA2 and PA3 as well as I2C. It features a footprint for a generic 3.3V or 5V LDO (e.g. CJ78L05, L78L33ACUTR), 
screw terminals for the analog inputs, a power LED and a footprint for a nunchuck. 

Always mount the diode, the LED and the LDO. For I2C also two 3k3 pullups (labeled I2C) are mounted, for ADC you can add up to two pulldowns and filter capacitors.
